# RecylerView AutoScroll


## Libraries Used
---
* [Architecture][2]: XML architecture is a markup language used to define the structure and content of data. In the Android application development process, XML files are commonly used to define user interface elements and resources in a hierarchical structure.
* [Viewbinding][4]: View binding is a feature that simplifies the process of writing code that interacts with views. When view binding is enabled in a module, a binding class is generated for each XML layout file present in that module. An instance of a binding class contains direct references to all views that have an ID in the corresponding layout.
* [RecyclerView][3]: RecyclerView makes it easy to efficiently display large sets of data.
